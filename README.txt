2 Overview
══════════

  This source code provides an implementation of the film grain rendering algorithm of Newson et al.


	The 'bin/film_grain_rendering_main' program reads a PNG or a TIFF image, and
	renders this image with film grain.

  Only 8bit GRAY PNG images are handled.


3 Requirement
═════════════

  The code is written in UTF8 C++, and should compile on any system with
  an UTF8 C++ compiler.

  The libpng and libtiff header and libraries are required on the system
  for compilation and execution. On Linux, just use your package manager
  to install it:
  ┌────
  │ sudo apt-get install libpng
  │ sudo apt-get install libtiff
  └────


  For more information, see [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html]
  and [http://www.libtiff.org/].


4 Compilation
═════════════

  To compile the code, use the provided makefile, with the command 'make'. The
  makefile will produce a program called : 'bin/film_grain_rendering_main'.

  It is possible to compile the program using OpenMP with the command
  'make OMP=1'.

  The 'film_grain_rendering_main' program is used to render an input image with film grain.


5 Usage
═══════

5.1 Film grain rendering
──────────

5.1.1 Description
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The 'film_grain_synthesis_main' program can be called, for example, in the following manner :
  ┌────
  │ bin/film_grain_rendering_main input.tiff output.png -r "0.1" -grainSigma "0.0" -filterSigma "0.8" -zoom "2.0" -algorithmID "0" -NmonteCarlo "100"
  └────
  input.tiff : input image. Can be a tiff or png image.
  output.tiff : output, rendered image. A tiff image.
  Parameters [default value]
  -r : average grain radius [0.1]
  -grainSigma : standard deviation of the grain radii, as a percentage of r [0.0]
  -filterSigma : standard deviation (in pixels) of the Gaussian filter applied to the continuous grain model [0.8]
  -zoom : zoom coefficient which increases the resolution of the output image with respect to the input image resolution [1.0]
  -algorithmID : identifier of the algorithm used. Can be equal to 0 (pixel-wise algorithm) or 1 (grain-wise algorithm) [0]
  -NmonteCarlo : number of Monte Carlo simulations [800]

  #Further parameters concerning zoom and resolution. These parameters are to be specified if the user wishes to zoom on a specific region of the input image and only carry out the rendering in this region. In this case, you should also specify the number of pixels in the x and y directions (nX, nY).
  #Note, if the 'zoom' parameter is activated, then the following parameters are ignored, as they may potentially be incompatible with the zoom.

  -nX : number of pixels in the x direction (number of columns). By default, this is set to the same number as in the input image.
  -nY : number of pixels in the y direction (number of rows). By default, this is set to the same number as in the input image.
  -xA : x coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle of the region in which the film grain rendering is carried out [0.0]
  -yA : y coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle of the region in which the film grain rendering is carried out [0.0]
  -xB : x coordinate of the bottom right corner of the rectangle of the region in which the film grain rendering is carried out [nX]
  -yB : y coordinate of the bottom right corner of the rectangle of the region in which the film grain rendering is carried out [nY]


5.1.2 Test command
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

You can test the code using the test image in the 'test' directory. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the film grain rendering code. Then type the following command in the terminal :

./bin/film_grain_rendering_main test/bateau.png bateau_out.png

This should execute without any problems. The result will be saved to the root directory.
